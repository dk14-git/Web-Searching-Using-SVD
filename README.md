# Web-Searching-Using-SVD

Search engines present a variety of information,
this information makes the user takes time to discover the
appropriate data. The best web information not only dominated
a search engine sometimes found on different machines with
more information on specific topics. In this research, search
engine optimization uses the Latent Semantic Indexing method of
collaborative search engines. Information will be on the filter
before it is sent to the user. The results of the study are expected
to sort information on multiple search engines and provide 
recommendation URLs that correspond to the keywords to help
users find the right information. There are many search engines
on the web, but they return a long list of search results, ranked by
their relevancies to the given query. Web users have to go through
the list and examine the titles and (short) snippets sequentially
to identify their required results. In this paper, we present how
usage of Singular Value Decomposition (SVI)) is a very good
solution for search results clustering.
